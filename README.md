## Building
### Linux/OS X/BSD/etc.
Should be pretty straightforward, you'll just have to set your D compiler in the makefile (currently the flags are all formatted for LDC), and then just `make` (and to run the program, `./main`).

### Windows
Still figuring this bit out!  I'll put instructions here once I do it, I swear.
